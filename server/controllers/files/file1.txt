Mahatma Gandhi - The Great Soul Who Led India's Independence Movement

Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was one of the greatest leaders and influential figures of the
 
20th century. Known for his nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience, Gandhi played a crucial role in India's struggle for
  
independence from British rule.

Gandhi's philosophy of Satyagraha, or "truth-force," emphasized the power of truth and nonviolence in bringing about social
 
and political change. Through peaceful protests, fasting, and acts of self-sacrifice, he mobilized millions of Indians to join the freedom movement.

His leadership during the Salt March in 1930, where he and thousands of followers marched over 240 miles to produce salt in defiance
 
of the British salt monopoly, became a defining moment in India's fight for independence. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to justiceand equality inspired people
 
around the world, earning him the title of "Mahatma," meaning "Great Soul."
